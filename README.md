###Bibliography project

This project was an attempt of a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) server that *nicely* wrap the citations of google scholar (registered) user, for deployement on [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) host. 

The project is not finished but it is working... until google block the request :-(

So, until google free up automated request, this project is dead.


Below is the current output of the page 'user/'. I still did not work on: 

 - item appearance: it only display the publication title
 - user selection: it display my publication list by default
